`&&` operator is a boolean AND operator: if the left side returns a non-zero exit status, the operator returns that
status and does not evaluate the right side (it short-circuits), otherwise it evaluates the right side and returns its
exit status. This is commonly used to make sure that command2 is only run if command1 ran successfully.  




The `;` token just separates commands, so it will run the second command regardless of whether or not the first one succeeds.











`&` and `&&` have different meanings

NPM Scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "script1 & script2"    // Run in parallel
    "build": "script1 && script2"   // Run sequentially (second runs only if first succeeds)
  }
}
```

Shell:

```zsh
# A in background, B in foreground, but both run in parallel
./cpu A & ./cpu B 

# A and B, both in background, but both run in parallel
./cpu A & ./cpu B &   

# B runs only if A succeeds (sequential), both in foregone
./cpu A && ./cpu B   
```

Within SAME terminal, we can run following commands

```zsh
ps        # List running processes 
jobs      # List background jobs (process created by `&`)
kill %1   # Kill job #1
fg %1     # Bring job #1 to foreground
```

# Difference between process and jobs
# why use screen when can use &


```zsh
Ctrl+C    # Kill a foreground process
Ctrl+Z    # Suspend a foreground process
bg        # Resume froegrounded process in background
```
